# Touch


- App Made during the HACK IIITD Hackathon..
- 
#Features :

1. ) Running in background so that child can touch to any tag and at any time so that the app can read the tag . 

2. ) After Reading the tag , we get the data from the HPE's API and then show as a text to the child , also  using YANDEX API to convert that particular text to speech for helping the visual impaired people.

3.) Using Google Images Api for the custom image search and youtube embed API .

#Want to Read a book :

- Scan the NFC Tag on the book and we fetch the link of the book from the server and will convert the complete book into text using the HPE's  OCR API and again a text to speech feature for visually impaired.

#Child Getting Bored :

- We have a inbuilt game in the app. which generates a random device from your houses which you can confirm by Tapping to the NFC Tag connected to it.
